            <h2>What is Diabetes?</h2>
            <p>It’s a condition that changes how the body turns food into energy. After eating food is broken down into
                sugar (glucose) and its travels to the bloodstream. This signals the pancreas to release insulin, it
                acts
                like a key and allows sugar to enter cells to use as energy. </p>
            <p>With diabetes, the body stops responding to insulin and sugar builds up in the blood stream. Over times
                serious health problems such as: vision loss, kidney disease and heart disease can occur.</p>

            <h3>Three Main Types of Diabetes</h3>
            <h4>Type 1</h4>
            <p>The pancreas doesn’t produce insulin or produces very little of it. Cells responsible for making insulin
                are
                destroyed.</p>

            <h4>Type 2</h4>
            <p>The body doesn’t use insulin properly, this is know as insulin resistance.</p>

            <h4>Gestational</h4>
            <p>Develops during pregnancy and usually return to normal after delivery.</p>

            <h3>Can Type 2 Diabetes be Prevented?</h3>
            <p>Believe it or not, type 2 diabetes can be prevented! Lifestyle changes such as getting more physical
                activity and choosing superfoods instead of junk food.</p>

            <h3>How the Body Turn Food Into Energy</h3>
            <p>Cells need a constant supply of energy, this energy comes from the food we eat. Food is made up of
                proteins,
                lipids and polysaccharides (many sugars). </p>
            <p>The body breaks down protein into amino acids, lipids into fatty acids and polysaccharides into sugars.
                Fats
                protect our nerves and is important for hormone production. Amino acids are the building block of
                proteins
                and sugars (glucose) travel to our cells for energy.</p>
            <h4>If proteins are broken down into amino acids, how does it turn back into protein?</h4>
            <p>Our body breaks down the proteins we eat and changes it into a protein our body can use. </p>

            <h3>What is the Pancreas Role?</h3>
            <p>Is located inside the abdomen, and it plays a big role in digestion by releasing enzymes. These enzymes
                are
                responsible for breaking down food which your body uses for energy.</p>

            <h3>Insulin Resistance</h3>
            <p>Is a hormone made by the pancreas in response to elevated glucose in the blood after you eat. Insulin
                acts as
                the key which unlocks the cell to allow glucose to enter the cell and be used for energy. </p>

            <p>Glucose can’t enter the cells, so sugar builds up in the bloodstream. Over time this is called
